*It's not assigned on module 6, but I wanted to try and see if I can edit a file in GitHub and then pull it down to RStudio.*

**It worked!**

*I created an empty file in the gitbash shell using the touch command. I opened it in RStudio, but did not enter any text. I added, committed, and pushed to git, where I added in the first three lines of text. I then pulled the edited markdown file back into RStudio, where I added this paragraph.*
